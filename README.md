 # Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (EDA Project)

## Project Overview

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding customer churn in the telecom domain.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status.

The objective is to identify patterns and factors that influence customer churn using visual and descriptive analysis.

Churn decreases with tenure and drops below 15% after 24+ months.

Customers with these services churn at 10–20%, indicating strong retention impact.

Streaming TV and Movies have limited influence (5–10% difference).
